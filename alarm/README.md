**What has been implemented**  
So far, the log reader has been implemented to the best of my knowledge.

**Collaborators/people I've discussed it with**  
I have not discussed this problem.

**Hours taken**  
2

**Are the heuristics used in this assignment to determine incidents "even that good"?**


**If you have spare time in the future, what would you add to the program or do differently with regards to detecting incidents?**


#TODO#
* write live alarm
* remove (some) notes
* Ask this question: What do we do if there is more than one thing wrong with the log? (ex. shellcode and 4\*\* error) Do we print each error? Just the first one we hit?
* remove sheep?

**NOTES** (about access.log)
* user-agent from nmap
